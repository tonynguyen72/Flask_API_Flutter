Please do the following to run the app (2 folders inside folder flutter_api)
1) Under the restapi_flask folder:
    - run terminal and type "pipenv shell" to activate virtual feature
    - type "flask run" or "python app.py" to access the port "http://127.0.0.1:5000/drink" (add "drink" to access the data) 

2) Under the sqlite_bloc folder:
